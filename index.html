  <h1>The cats of America are under siege!</h1>
<div class="p-tag"> 

   <p>Long gone are the good old days when a cat's biggest worries were mean<br> dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, online predators, the <br>possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and<br> countless other threats to their nine lives.<br>
   <p>For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood at <br>the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare our nation's cat<br> owners for the difficult conversations they dread having with their pets.</p>
  <p>Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety <br>answers crucial questions such as, "What is the right age to talk to my cat<br> about the proper use of firearms?" and "What are the benefits of my cat<br>living a lifestyle of abstinence?" and especially "Why does my cat need to<br> use the internet? Can't he just play with yarn like cats used to do?"</p>
